# Changelog Policy

## User-Facing Entries Only

Changelog entries are for end users. Keep them concise and avoid implementation details.

**Do not include:**
- Component names (e.g., `WorkflowCreationSection`, `AppSidebar`)
- File or page paths (e.g., `/dashboard/[slug]/testing`)
- Internal utilities or API endpoints (e.g., `isFeatureEnabled`, `/api/auto-detect/[slug]`)
- Technical refactoring details (e.g., "useState lazy initializers")

**Do include:**
- User-visible features and improvements
- Plain-language descriptions of what changed
- Outcomes and benefits, not implementation

### Example

```markdown
❌ BAD: "WorkflowCreationSection component for guided workflow creation on the home page"
✅ GOOD: "Guided workflow creation on the home page"

❌ BAD: "Updates AppSidebar, FeatureCard, GetStartedButton, RepositoryCard components"
✅ GOOD: "Improved navigation and UI"
```

## Never Retroactively Change Entries

**Do not edit or remove existing changelog entries.** Changelog entries are historical records of what was released at each version. Editing past entries:

- Rewrites release history
- Breaks version comparison and audit trails
- Can confuse users who rely on accurate release notes

### Correct Approach

- **Add new entries** only for new releases
- **Append to current/upcoming** version if you're still developing
- **Leave past entries unchanged** even if features are later removed

### Example

```markdown
❌ BAD: Removing "Testing Frameworks" from v1.5.0 after it was removed in a later refactor
✅ GOOD: Add a new v1.6.0 entry: "Removed Testing Frameworks feature"
```
