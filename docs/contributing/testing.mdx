# Frameworks

We use the following frameworks:

- **Unit tests:** Vitest with jsdom environment
- **API tests:** Vitest with node environment
- **E2E tests:** Playwright

# Running tests

## Unit tests

Unit tests are located in `apps/web/__tests__/unit/` and test components, utilities, and hooks in isolation.

```bash
# Run unit tests
bun run test:unit

# Run with coverage
bun run test:coverage:unit

# Watch mode (re-run on file changes)
bun run test:watch

# Open test UI
bun run test:ui
```

## API tests

API tests are located in `apps/web/__tests__/api/routes/` and test Next.js API route handlers.

```bash
# Run API tests
bun run test:api

# Run with coverage
bun run test:coverage:api
```

## E2E tests

E2E tests are located in `e2e/tests/` and test the full application flow in a real browser environment.

> **Note:** Playwright browsers are automatically installed via `postinstall` script when dependencies are installed.


**Prerequisites:**
- Set up environment variables in `e2e/.env` (see `e2e/README.md` for details)
- Ensure PostgreSQL database is running and schema is initialized

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
bun run test:e2e

# Run smoke tests only
bun run test:e2e:login

# Run with UI (interactive)
bun run test:e2e:ui

# Run in debug mode
bun run test:e2e:debug

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
bun run test:e2e:headed
```

> **Note:** Before running other E2E tests, authenticate first by running `bun run test:e2e:auth-setup` to save authenticated state.

# GitHub Actions

Each test suite has a corresponding GitHub Action workflow which run daily.
Each workflow supports `workflow_dispatch`, which enables manual runs against committed branches.
