title: GitHub Actions status
---

OmniLens automatically monitors GitHub Actions status and displays a banner at the top of your dashboard when GitHub is experiencing outages.

This helps you quickly determine if workflow failures are due to GitHub's infrastructure issues rather than problems with your code.

## Banner Information

The banner shows:
- **Status level**: Orange for partial outages, red for major outages
- **Status message**: Brief explanation of what's happening
- **Last updated**: When the status was last refreshed (e.g., "Just now", "5m ago")

## Banner Controls

Three buttons help you manage the banner:

- **Refresh** - Check for the latest status update
- **External Link** - Open GitHub's official status page for detailed information
- **Dismiss** - Hide the banner (it reappears if you refresh the page and the issue persists)
