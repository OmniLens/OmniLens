OmniLens is an open-source platform for **visualizing and tracking** GitHub Actions workflow health.

OmniLens is designed to:

- **Ingest workflow signals** from tests, checks, and jobs
- **Track** health and consistency across workflow runs
- **Clearly surface** what’s healthy, regressing, or inactive

OmniLens **never owns execution** — only interpretation.
