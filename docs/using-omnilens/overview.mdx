OmniLens is an open source **quality decision intelligence platform** that transforms GitHub Actions chaos into actionable insights.

It gives you complete visibility into your CI/CD pipeline health, helping you identify bottlenecks, track success rates, and optimize your development workflow.

Just connect your repositories and instantly see which workflows are failing, when they're running, and how they're performing over time.

OmniLens is designed to:

- **Ingest test signals** from UI, API, unit tests, and other sources
- **Analyze stability and meaning** over time
- **Help teams decide** what to trust, what to act on, and what risk to accept

OmniLens **never owns execution** — only interpretation.  
It works alongside your existing CI/CD infrastructure to provide intelligence and insights.
