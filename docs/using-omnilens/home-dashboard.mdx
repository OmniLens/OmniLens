## Add a Repository Card

`insert gif here <(''<)`

Enter a GitHub repository URL or `owner/repo` format in the add repository dialog.  
OmniLens accepts both formats and will:

1. **Validation**: Verifies the repository exists and you have access to it
2. **Addition**: Adds the repository card to your dashboard
3. **Data Fetching**: Discovers and fetches workflow definitions to display initial run data

> You can add up to 12 **public** repository cards to your dashboard

## Repository Card Overview

Each repository card on your dashboard provides a compact overview of your repository's workflow activity:

### Metrics Display

The repository card displays the following metrics:

- **Daily Success Rate**: A progress bar showing the percentage of successful workflow runs
- **Total Workflows**: The number of workflows configured in the repository
- **Passed Runs**: Count of workflow runs that completed successfully
- **Failed Runs**: Count of workflow runs that failed
- **In Progress Runs**: Count of workflow runs currently running

### Card Actions

Each repository card includes interactive elements:

- **GitHub icon**: Navigate directly to the repository on GitHub in a new tab
- **Trash can icon**: Remove the repository card and all its associated data from your dashboard
